# Medical-Office-Scheduler

## Description
A certain medical office does home visits for housebound patients. Scheduling the visits
efficiently is important, and I will build a prototype web-based system to help. Every afternoon
the scheduler starts with a list of patients to be visited tomorrow. For each patient, she has the
mane, whether or not this is a new patient, and sometimes time constraints. For example, if the
patientâ€™s daughter needs to be there but is only available in the anteroom. There is also a patient
master list, which contains names, addresses, approximate map coordinates, etc. the output is a
tentative schedule, which she can edit if necessary, and then give to the clinician who will do the
home visits. The goal of assignment 1 is to learn how PHP works and what its features are.

## Installation
Clone or download this repostory and open it using a IDE that supports PHP server, or upload it to your server and open it.
